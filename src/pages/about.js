            <p>My name is Terry Sanchez Iâ€™ve been in the animal services industry for the past 14 years. I started as an animal control officer and achieved Director of Animal Services before leaving. I am looking to change career paths to web development. Before I started as an animal control officer I had taken CCNA 1 from NWAC and served as tech support for my previous job at the Embassy Suites in Rogers. I hope after completing this class it will help facilitate a job and the start of a new career.   </p>
